ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @segolene-mennesson

ðŸ”„ I just switched career from academia, teaching and researching in political science and sociology, to data analytics

ðŸš… On 8th December, 2023, I graduated Data Analytics bootcamp at Le Wagon Brussels

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking for a junior data analyst position

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently training in coding with SQL and Python doing dayly challenges for the bootcamp again but also started collaborating with Data For Good
